The original author of Qwicky (Fabian Streitel) licensed his
nice software to the public as follows:

/*---- DON'T PANIC License 1.1 -----------

  Don't panic, this piece of software is
  free, i.e. you can do with it whatever
  you like, including, but not limited to:
  
    * using it
    * copying it
    * (re)distributing it
    * burning/burying/shredding it
    * eating it
    * using it to obtain world domination
    * and ignoring it
  
  Under the sole condition that you
  
    * CONSIDER buying the author a strong
      brownian motion producer, say a nice
      hot cup of tea, should you ever meet
      him in person.

----------------------------------------*/

The forking one (Elias Amaral) is licensing his bad quality
modifications to the public under the same licensing
conditions, EXCEPT that:

* You don't have even to CONSIDER buying him a strong brownian
  motion producer.
